# Semantics
Tucker and Zucker [2001] gave an algebraic "operational semantics" for WhileCC-programs. Here we work with "denotational semantics" for WhileCC-programs.
In order to represent the denotational semantics, we need to
  - define a ($\omega$-complete partial order) with bottom $\bot$.
  - show the semantic operators are $\omega$-Scott continuous
    + Monotonicity
    + Scott-continuity
Then knowing that F is Scott-continuous on a $\omega$-complete partial order with $\bot$, then:  
  $lfp(F) = \Cup \{F^n(\bot ) | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$  
exists, and is the least fixed point of F.
This gives us the denotation of our recursive function.
